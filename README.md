# Enzo Campos - Profile

Hello! My name is **Enzo Guimarães Campos**, and I'm currently a computer engineering undergraduate student at UNICAMP, Brazil. Although my main interest revolves around Brain Machine Interfaces, Neuroscience, Health data signal processing and Neural networks, the projects currently displayed here show more about my undergrad couse's assignments than what I am currently researching.

Some details about myself:
- I've already coded in ARM assembly language for microcontrolers, C, Java and HTML/CSS/JS for undergrad couses, but my main experience in research is with Python.
- I'm currently part of the [**Viva Bem**](https://vivabem.unicamp.br/) team, and have already researched topics about Sleep disorders (such as RBD) and Anxiety. Sadly, still none of them made into a full paper, but we'll get there eventually.
- I am really passionate about problem solving and love being creative. Don't show me anything that desperatly needs a solution, or I'll spend the whole day thinking about it. And if it's about the human brain, expect the topic to be around in my thoughts for a week or more.
- I'm brazilian, natural of Santos-SP, although after many movings, my family settled down on Campinas when I was 10. I'm also a casual gamer and anime watcher, for I really love Japanese culture. I also play a bit of keyboard, but I'm far away from a professional pianist. My musician side ended up fueling my broad taste for music, with a peculiar favoritism to ambience and background lyric-less music.

# Main Projects

Currently, I have two big projects posted here:
- A collaborative project I worked on for my undergrad's Object Oriented Programming couse, a game called [**Amnésia**](https://github.com/Projetos-Enzo-e-Luisa-POO/OOProjects/tree/main/amnesia);
- Another collaborative electronics project, also for an undergrad course, that uses BLE to comunicate a RP pico W with an ESP32 for interfacing and controlling a 3D printed mechanical arm, named [**BitArm**](https://github.com/NuitJack/BitArm).
